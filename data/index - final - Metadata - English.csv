ale_rest_def,Q1: What constitutional constraints are there on the fiscal deficit?,"No, it's not about Executive-Legislative relations.",,,Borrowing constraints subindex,"No restrictions (0 points). Budget should include proper financing for deficit (5 points). Deficits are not allowed (10 points). | None of the countries has a balanced budget rule, which would have resulted in 10 points, nor do they have constraints such as the ones that exist for the European Union countries, reflected in the Maastricht criteria. 5 points were assigned to countries that the budget document must identify the sources of financing of the deficit, while zero points were given to those countries that responded that there are no constitutional constraints on the deficit.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_macro_ap,Q2: Is there a legal requirement for the approval of a macro program to precede the presentation of the budget to Congress? How important is this requirement in practice?,No institutional change in Brazil.,Poder de Revisão,,Borrowing constraints subindex,"Very important (10 points). Relatively important (5 points).  Not important Score or not required (0 points). | We assigned 10 points for those countries that reported that the macro program plays an important role as a prerequisite for the submission of the budget to Congress, 5 points for “some importance”, and 0 for “not important or not required”. Information by country and scores are presented in table A2.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_rest_borr,Q3: What kind of borrowing constraints are there on the government?,"No, it's not about Executive-Legislative relations.",,,Borrowing constraints subindex,"The highest scores (10) were given to countries where Congress sets a ceiling on what the government may borrow, as this was considered more restrictive than having the government setting a constraint upon itself (6.66 points were assigned in this case). In fact, having Congress setting the debt ceiling before the budget is approved is equivalent to discussing the size of the budget first, and its composition later. Having each borrowing operation approved by Congress may have disruptive effects, since it may lead to recurrent bargaining between government and Congress on other budget issues, shifting the balance of power from the Executive to Congress. This view, based on the experience in government of two of the authors of this study, led us to assign countries where this arrangement is in place 3.33 points. In cases where case by case approval is combined with an overall ceiling by Congress, we averaged both scores, assigning those countries 6.66 points. The lowest scores (0) were given to countries in which the government can borrow without constraints, whenever revenues fall short of expenditures.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_minfin_p,Q4: Is the authority of the Minister of Finance greater than that of the spending ministers on budgetary issues?,"No, it's not about Executive-Legislative relations.",,,Agenda-setting subindex,"In most countries, the Treasury Minister does have a considerably higher standing than spending ministers on budgetary issues. We assigned 10 points to these countries. Five points were assigned to those where the Treasury Minister has a somewhat higher standing, and 0 for the case where they are on equal footing with the spending ministers.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_rest_am,Q5: Restrictions on the content of amendments to the budget by Congress: Congress can only pass amendments...,cav_rest_em,Poder de Emenda,,Agenda-setting subindex,"Those countries where amendments cannot increase the size of the budget, or its size and the deficit, were given 10 points. If the legislature cannot increase spending or the deficit over the amount proposed by the government autonomously, but they can do it with government’s approval, we assigned 7.5 points, since in this case changes in the budget could be subject to negotiations, where the legislature could agree to pass other legislation proposed by the government in exchange for increases in the budget. In table A5, which contains information and scores country by country, this case is represented by marking the third and fourth column, indicating that the legislature cannot increase deficits or spending unless government approves. We assigned 5 points for the case where the legislature can only propose changes that may not increase the deficit. This constraint leaves a loophole for the legislature to amend the budget increasing the expenditure level, and at the same time pass legislation creating new revenues (more or less “real”), which might then fall short of expectations, resulting in the end in larger deficits. Zero points were assigned in the case of no constraints.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_no_app_h,"Q6: What happens if Congress rejects the budget, or does not approve it within the constitutionally set time frame?",cav_no_app_h,Poder de Revisão,,Agenda-setting subindex,"An extreme “hierarchical” case, which applies to several countries in the region, is the one in which the budget proposed by the government is executed, even if Congress rejects it or fails to approve it (10 points were assigned to these countries). A number of countries have different rules for rejection or lack of approval. In most of these cases, lack of approval in time results in the proposed budget being enacted, while rejection results in the previous year budget being adopted. We assigned 8 points for this case. We considered the case where the previous year budget is adopted more favorable to the government than the case in which a new budget has to be presented to Congress, as long as the government can redistribute spending between items (we assigned six points for this case, but only 2 when the government does not have the possibility of reallocating expenditures). In the cases where a new budget has to be presented, a greater degree of discretion for the government in terms of reallocating expenditures until the new budget is approved is given higher marks (4 points) than the case where there is no reallocation (2 points) or the case where Congress reallocates expenditures (0 points). In The Bahamas, as is the case in many parliamentary systems, the government has to resign in case the budget is rejected. In terms of the balance of power between Congress and the government, this drastic possibility could go either way. One could argue that, since rejection is very costly for the country, the legislature will have incentives to always agree on a budget. On the other hand, this institutional arrangement may induce the government to propose a budget that is more palatable to Congress. Thus we assigned an intermediate score (5 points) for this case. In Mexico, no funds may be expended if the budget is rejected. Given that the government moves first in this game, we believe that this arrangement tilts the balance of power in their favor, so we assigned Mexico 8 points (see table A6 for information by country).",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_exec_modif,Q7: Can the budget be modified after Congress approval?,cav_exec_modif,Flexibilidade do Executivo na Execução,,Borrowing constraints subindex,"We assigned the best score in the case where it is not possible to modify it (10 points). Consistent with the case of questions 5 and 6, we rate those systems where the initiative to modify the budget falls on the government as more hierarchical than those where it may be modified at Congress’ initiative (we assigned 0 points in this last case). However, provided the government has the initiative, we assigned a larger score (7.5) for the case where the government requires the legislature’s approval. When the government can modify the budget autonomously, we distinguished those systems where they may do so up to a limit of 10 percent (5 points) and those where the limits are less stringent or do not exist (2.5 points).",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_cut_sp,Q8: Is the government legally empowered to cut spending after the budget has been approved?,cav_exec_imp,Flexibilidade do Executivo na Execução,,Borrowing constraints subindex,"Q8 asks whether the government can cut spending after the budget is passed. Here there are conflicting arguments regarding government discretion in cutting the budget. Intuitively, it would seem that the possibility of cutting the budget will result in smaller deficits. However, it is also possible that the government will not have incentives to submit a small budget if they can cut it later at their discretion. And later on, it may be difficult to cut it even if this was intended from the beginning. In addition, the executed budget might not reflect the spending priorities implicit in the budget passed by the legislature. In this case, the budgetary process becomes less transparent, an “less meaningful as a way to allocate scarce resources among competing spending programs. For these reasons, we assigned the highest score to those countries where the government can only cut the budget when revenues are lower than projected, rather than those who can cut without restrictions (6.66 points). A score of 0 was assigned to those countries in which the government cannot cut spending unilaterally under any circumstance (see table A8). | At government's discretion on any item: 6.66; At goverment's discretion for non-earmarked expendidures: 6.66; Only when revenues are lower then projected: 10; No: 0.",Alesina et al (1999)
ale_deb_assup,Q9: Does the central government typically assume debt originally contracted by other public agencies? Under what circumstances?,"No, it's not about Executive-Legislative relations.",,,Borrowing practicies subindex,"The ideal case in terms of budget control is one in which the Central Government never assumes debt contracted by other agencies, but none of the countries had this type of arrangement, which would have been assigned a score of 10. The next best case is one in which the government only assumes the guaranteed debt, and this occurs only on an occasional basis (6.66 points). Frequent cases of assuming only guaranteed debt was considered as problematic as occasional assumptions of debt, including that which was not guaranteed (3.33 points). A score of zero was given to those countries where the Central Government frequently assumes even the non-guaranteed debt. In our first questionnaire, we asked what percentage of the current Central Government debt was originally contracted by other public agencies. We used the response to this question to complement the one about the frequency of debt assumption: the response “occasionally” was changed to “frequently” for those countries that reported that a large portion of the current debt of the Central government was originally contracted by other agencies. Mexico reported that the central government has assumed debt originally contracted by other public agencies only exceptionally, and that in such cases the agencies which could not repay their debts were subject to severe restructuring or liquidation. We assigned this country 7.5 points (see table A9 for information and scores by country).",Alesina et al (1999)

State and local governments,"No, it's not about Executive-Legislative relations.",,,Borrowing practicies subindex,"The highest marks were assigned to those countries where these agencies cannot borrow autonomously (10 points). In the case of the local governments, the requirement of approval by the local legislature (2.5 points) was not considered to add much discipline to the budgetary process compared to the case where there are no restrictions to borrowing, which is the case that can lead to more fiscal surprises, and to which we assigned a score of 0. We assume that control by the central government adds more discipline (7.5 points) than control by Congress (5 points), since in a way the interests of the legislators are aligned with those of the districts that elect them. In contrast, in the case of public enterprises, approval by Congress was considered equivalent to approval by the central government (5 points). The total score for this question is the average of the partial scores for state and local governments, and public enterprises, respectively.",Alesina et al (1999)
